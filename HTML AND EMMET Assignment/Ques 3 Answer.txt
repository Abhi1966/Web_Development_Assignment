3. Write a short note on tags, elements, and attributes along with relevant examples ?

Ans: In HTML, tags, elements, and attributes are very helpful to define the structure and the content of a web page.

Tags:


In HTML, tags are used to mark up and define the content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets, and usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. There are many different types of HTML tags available, each with its own specific purpose. 

Example: <p>I am happy to learn Web Development.</p>. In this example, the opening tag is <p> and the closing tag is </p>. 

Elements:

HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. An HTML element is made up of a start tag, content, and an end tag (in most cases).

Example: <p>I am happy to learn Web Development.</p>. In this example, the opening tag is <p> and the closing tag is </p>. The content along with the tags is the paragraph element.

Attributes:

In HTML, attributes provide additional information about an element. They are usually included in the opening tag of the element.

Example: <a href="https://google.com" >Go To Google</a>. In this example, the a element is used to create a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL that the hyperlink points to. The attribute values are enclosed in quotes.
